enrolled in 4th year .


Himanshu's intro :  .......................


Today , we will present the final version of : Blindâ€™s Eye : IoT based real-time surrounding identification 
and object detection . Professor Tufan Saha has been our mentor for this project . Lets get 
started !


3. Problem : 285 million people in the world who are visually impaired of whom 39 million are 
blind . Without other person's help , they can rarely carry out day to day activity . In today's
busy world of traffic and frauds , this has become a major problem .We want to help them .
 


5. Approach : We recieve surrounding image in real time through camera . They are passed to our ML model
which makes itelligent predictions . The output text is then converted to speech . The speech is let out 
as sound to the earpiece which is carried by the user .



7. Code : This is a small code snippet from YOLO v3  which shows our implementation . We perform image cropping 
and pass on this image to a series of convolutional layers . The final output layer gives the desired 
output


9. In the output section we can see that the cars have been identified . The device provides the neccesary
instructions.


10. These are the references we have taken.
